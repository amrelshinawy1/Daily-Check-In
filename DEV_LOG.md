# Development Log


### Initial Setup
- Started with Turborepo monorepo structure
- Chose Tamagui for UI (first time using it!)
- Set up React Native + TypeScript for frontend
- Express + TypeScript for backend

### Decisions Made
- **Emoji-based mood selection**: More fun and universal than dropdowns
- **Energy scale 1-10**: Simple and intuitive
- **Optional notes**: Keep it simple for MVP
- **Hardcoded suggestions**: Good enough for now, can improve later

### Challenges Faced
- ESLint config was tricky to get right
- Docker setup took longer than expected
- iOS build issues (need to set up React Native CLI properly)


### What's Working
- ✅ Basic mood selection with emojis
- ✅ Energy slider with color coding
- ✅ Notes input
- ✅ API integration
- ✅ Basic error handling

### What Needs Work
- [ ] Better error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Form validation
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Local storage for history

### Technical Debt
- Hardcoded API URL in frontend
- Console.log instead of proper logging
- No input sanitization
- No rate limiting
- No database yet

## 2024-01-XX - Future Plans

### Short-term (this week)
- Fix iOS build issues
- Add local storage
- Improve error handling
- Add form validation

### Medium-term (next month)
- Add user authentication
- Database integration
- Analytics dashboard
- Push notifications

### Long-term
- Social features
- Health app integrations
- Machine learning suggestions

## Notes to Self

- Remember to add proper error boundaries
- Consider adding a design system
- Think about accessibility
- Plan for internationalization
- Consider adding tests for edge cases
